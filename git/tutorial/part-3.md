# Branching

* Command: On your local machine run the following command `git checkout -b <mybranchname>` 
* Details: For the same repository we have branched off the code. This allows developers to work on their own features/fixes without breaking other developers work

* Commands: Make changes with VS Code, add the files `git add .` and commit `git commit -m"my commit message"` just like you would on  the main/master branch 
* Details: We are creating the commit but on a different branch. The main branch remains unaffected.

* Commands: Push the branch to the remote with `git push origin <mybranchname>`
* Details: We have pushed to the remote repository on the branch. When you go into github you can now select the new branch
