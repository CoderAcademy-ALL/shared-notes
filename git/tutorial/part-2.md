# Forking

Github allows you to fork a repository

* Command: In the github.com go to https://github.com/CoderAcademy-ALL/ascii-museum and select the fork button in the top right. 
* Details: We are copying the remote repository to a new user. The two code bases have now diverged. You now have twp parallel repositories that are independent of each other. Kind of like the movie Sliding Doors https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-Mizk86AE
