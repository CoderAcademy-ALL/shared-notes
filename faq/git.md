## Sourcetree vs git commandline

- `Q:` Question about sourcetree. I'm trying to use terminal and Sourcetree to do some version control practice. Does it mean the functions of Sourcetree is same as the order code like 'git add', git commit -m' and so on? If it is right, can I use Sourcetree replace the terminal.

- `Q:` Starting out what do you recommend using, Git on the command line or sourcetree?
