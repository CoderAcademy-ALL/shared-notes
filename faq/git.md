## Sourcetree vs git commandline 

* `Q:` Question about sourcetree. I'm trying to use terminal and Sourcetree to do some version control practice. Does it mean the functions of Sourcetree is same as the order code like 'git add', git commit -m' and so on? If it is right, can I use Sourcetree replace the terminal.
* `A:`
  * Yes the command order is the same as in the terminal
  * Yes everything you can do in the terminal can be done in source tree and vice versa
